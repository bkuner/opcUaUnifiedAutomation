# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

OPCUA=$(TOP)/..

# When developing against a public or shared repo:
#   Do not edit the locations in this file!
#
# You may create a file RELEASE.local pointing to your locations
# of the OPCUA device support and EPICS_BASE, e.g.
#   OPCUA = /home/install/epics/opcua
#   EPICS_BASE = /home/install/epics/base
#
# Inside an embedded TOP, use the following definitions
# pointing to the configuration of the parent module
-include $(TOP)/../../RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/../../configure/RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/../configure/RELEASE.local

# Inside a standalone TOP, use the following definitions instead
#-include $(TOP)/../RELEASE.local
#-include $(TOP)/../configure/RELEASE.local

# The definition in this directory always overrides
-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local
